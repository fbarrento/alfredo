# Alfredo

Alfredo is your friendly self-hosting assistant.

You may think of it as an "App Store" but for open source applications that you can host yourself.
It has a catalog of "1-click install" self-hosted applications you may install on your servers.

It has a dashboard so you can have a clear vision of your server and apps.

You may also install your Git Applications, developed by you or your team, in the advanced mode.

For the documentation, please visit [Alfredo Website]([./docs/index.md](https://getalfredo.com/)).
